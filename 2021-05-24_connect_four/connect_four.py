"""
Make a 2-player Connect Four game, where the board is 7 units wide, and 6 units
high. Your program should take in user input when a player puts in a piece, and
have functions boardState() (which returns a 2D array of the current state of
the board) and hasWon() which returns which player has won the game (if any).
