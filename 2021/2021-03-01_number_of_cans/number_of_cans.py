"""
Given a room size, and the square footage a paint can can cover, return how
many cans of paint you need to buy to paint a room. Assume the room has four
walls. If youâ€™d like to expand this, you can add doors, windows, or any other
room features that might make the problem interesting to solve.

Example:

room = { length: 12, width: 10, height: 9 }
canCoverage = 200

$ numberOfCans(room, canCoverage)
$ 2 // (12 * 9 * 2) + (10 * 9 * 2) = 396, so two cans will cover it
