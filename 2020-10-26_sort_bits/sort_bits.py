"""
Given an integer array arr, sort the integers in arr in ascending order by the number of 1â€™s in their binary representation and return the sorted array.

Examples:

$ sortBits([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
$ [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
"""

def sort_bits(xs):
    # bin(x) returns a string like '0b11', so strip off '0b'
    return sorted(xs, key=lambda x: sum(map(int, bin(x)[2:])))


def test_example():
    assert sort_bits([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]) == [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
